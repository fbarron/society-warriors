# Society Warriors

A university-focused platform that improves visibility and discovery of student societies beyond Freshers’ Week.

## Problem
University society events are fragmented across Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, posters, and word of mouth. Students miss events, and smaller societies struggle to recruit consistently.

## Solution
Society Warriors provides a single, university-specific feed where societies can post events and updates, and students can easily discover, filter, and join societies they are interested in.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend & Backend:** React + Next.js (App Router)  
- **Styling & UI:** TailwindCSS
- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth (email / student ID-based login)

## Key Features
- Student login and registration
- University selection (e.g. RGU, University of Aberdeen)
- Society filtering by category
- Centralised society post feed
- Members-only posts
- Join society workflow
- Society admin post creation

## Target Users
- University students
- Society committee members

## Tech Demo Scope
This repository focuses on a functional MVP demonstrating core user flows rather than a production-ready system.
